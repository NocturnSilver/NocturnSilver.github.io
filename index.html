                    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
                    <p> 
                        Hello, I am Nathan. I am currently undertaking an Msc in Computer Science at the University of Liverpool. I took an Undergraduate in Applied Physics, 
                        and decided I wanted to spend time learning computing in order to merge ideas in physics and computing. I am particularly interested
                        in file compression algorithms, web programming, robotics, numerical modelling, and computer numerical control.

                    <h2>Career Goal</h2>
                    <p> 
                        As of the moment my career goals in the field of computer science would be to contribute in the field of computer vision for robotics. 
                        However, I am also quite interested in pursuing a career in software development particularly open-source software developemnt. If I were to pursue 
                        a PhD in physics, I would like to contribute in numerical modelling for physical phenomena.

                    <h2>Interests</h2>

                    <p> 
                        I am interested in <strong>building circuits</strong> and working with arduinos and Raspberry Pis. I have made a number of
                        experimental setups for electromagnetism experiments by making circuits for it. An example of such would be measuring
                        the magnetic field of an N-loop wire coil made by assembling a current regulator using a TIP41 and 2N5551 transistor.

                    <p>
                        I am also quite fond of <strong>music</strong>. In fact, I always have a playlist ready for each day.
                        I use different music to set the mood for different situations. An example of that would be when i make pixel art for my game.
                        I don't particularly have a favorite genre, but these days i find myself listening to 
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Da7RgPXCmU">piano music</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4nkcqObktk">atmospheric-like music</a>,

                    <h2>Achievements</h2>

                    <p> 
                        I have achieved a Magna Cum Laude for my undergraduate degree. I also took an online course for quantum computing by QxQ sponsored by IBM, and
                        was awarded a certificate for it. I had to manage time and energy due to my undergraduate academic load and 
                        time zone differences for the course
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also won 2nd place in a painting competition with a cash reward. The painting resides in a glass cabinet in my high school. However,
                        I regret to inform that I don't have a picture of the painting with me.

                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

                    <p>
                        I have a number of hobbies. However, there are a few hobbies that stand out. In particular, I used to play an unhealthy amount 
                        of <strong>video games</strong> with over 2000+ hours in Dota 2 and over 600 hours in CS2. These days I don't play video games as often, but I do try to find time for it.
                        The genre of games I play are wide and varied ranging from mainstream FPS games, relaxing city builders, to story-rich visual novels. 
                        Playing video games naturally lead to an interest in making my own video games and studying computer science. 
                        Funny enough, this lead to other hobbies such as creating sprites using pixel art and programming my own game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Video games are a big part of why I am still doing <strong>art</strong>. However, the reason I started making art wasn't because of video games.
                        A lot of my family members do at least some form of art which naturally lead to me taking up a curiosity and passion for it.
                        When I was in elementary school I joined a painting club for 7 years. This taught me basic art principles
                        and theory of color and forms as well as the techniques for drawing and painting. These days I don't paint much anymore, 
                        but I still apply things I learned years ago such as color theory and perspectives when I create pixel art and designs. 
                        Examples of my works are shown below:
